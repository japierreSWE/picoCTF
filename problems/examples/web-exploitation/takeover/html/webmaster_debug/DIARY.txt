Dear diary,

I've finally been making some progress getting this website done, and made a new tool to help. With this new diagnostics system, I can check the status of my website without having to log in as admin.

However, as usual, my friends are harassing me about my Linux setup. They keep telling me to upgrade my bash version. What's the big deal if I use bash 4.2? Apparently, there's some famous bash vulnerability, and they think someone's going to use it to do things on my system that they're not supposed to. Well, I looked it up, and that vulnerability came out years ago. Who in their right mind would try using it today?

Anyway, I should get back to making my website. It's been in construction for quite a while.
